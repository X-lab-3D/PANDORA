PANDORA
========

`PANDORA`_ is a fast, modularized and highly flexible anchor-restrained modelling pipeline
for generating peptide-MHC structures.

PANDORA contains useful APIs for pre-processing pMHC template data, identify the most adequate
template and adapt the modelling to the specifc case.

Disclaimer: While PANDORA pMHC-I manuscript has been published `Frontiers in Immunology`_ ,
PANDORA pMHC-II paper is under preparation.

**Pandora highlights**:

- Automated Database collection from IMGT/3d-structureDB
- Modularized peptide:MHC I and II modelling approach
- Flexible modelling scripts (editable by MODELLER expert users)
