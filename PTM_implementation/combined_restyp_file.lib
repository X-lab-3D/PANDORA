# LIBRARY OF RESIDUE TYPES
#
# MODELLER 1.1, Copyright Andrej Sali
#
#
# Several residue naming schemes exist: 
# 
#   (1) Three-letter Brookhaven Protein Data Bank, extended.
#   (2) Single-letter Brookhaven Protein Data Bank, extended.
#   (3) Four letter CHARMM, extended.
# 
# 
# This file gives:
# 
#   (1) The residue names in those three sets.
#   (2) Equivalences between the three sets.
# 
# Each residue type may have several PDB-3 names, but only one PDB-1 
# name and one CHARMM name. The naming schemes are case sensitive. If
# a certain existing CHARMM residue type does not have an equivalent 
# in the PDB-1/3 lists, its name is invented, or the name of a similar 
# residue is used. In contrast, if an existing PDB residue type does 
# not occur in the CHARMM list, its name is kept undefined (####) 
# so that the lack of the CHARMM topology entry is properly flagged. 
# This means that a certain residue's name may appear several times 
# within the same scheme (for example, CHARMM charged and neutral
# species are not distinguished in the PDB list).
#
# Each residue type can be ATOM, DEFATM, or HETATM. The first two
# correspond to PDB ATOM records, and the last to HETATM.
#
# The first 21 residue types are hard-coded, and their order should not be
# changed. For certain applications (e.g. alignment) only these residue types
# are supported. Other residues will be treated as equivalent to that named
# in the 'STD' column, or if blank, as the default residue type defined on
# the DEFATM line.
#
# To add a new residue type, simply add a new line to the end of this file.
# Note that multiple names can be listed in the PDB-3 column, because PDB
# can use different names for the same residue type (e.g. water can be HOH,
# WAT, etc.). The PDB-1 code must be a single character. It does not have to
# be unique, but if it is not unique you cannot use it in the alignment file.
# Any character is fine (it does not have to be a letter). If you run out of
# characters you can re-define the existing ones that you do not need. The
# CHARMM field gives the four-character CHARMM residue name, as specified
# in the RESI record of the topology library.
